                <h2>The Field of Analytics</h2>

                <p>
                    According to Ms. Qistina, analytics refer to the systematic
                    analytics of data to extract meaningful insights and make
                    informed decisions. It involves examining large sets of data
                    to identify patterns, trends, correlations, and other
                    valuable information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Analytics can be applied in various fields, including
                    business, finance, healthcare, sports, transportation, and
                    more.

                <h2>Workplace Culture in Credence</h2>

                <p>
                    Credence was a pretty small company. Thus, the workplace
                    culture in Credence was tighly incorporated across all
                    workers.
                </p>

                <h3>Open Communication</h3>

                <p>
                    Everyone was free to communicate with each other. Ms.
                    Qistina expressed how easy it was to communicate with other
                    departments, and even managers. She could openly express to
                    her managers if a role was not suited for her. Her
                    supervisor helped a lot during her 4 years of career.
                </p>

                <h3>Continuous Learning and Develpoment</h3>

                <p>
                    Ms. Qistina was given a lot of opportunity to get
                    certifications, and there was a free e-learning that she
                    could take. Her managers took a lot of time to develop her
                    life and work skills.
                </p>

                <h3>Empowerment and Autonomy</h3>

                <p>
                    Ms. Qistina was taught to trust herself in doing her job. If
                    the managers saw that she could do her job well, they would
                    gave more trust to her to take charge of her own projects.
                </p>

                <h3>Celebration of Success</h3>

                <p>
                    Credence celebrates good performance of workers and gave
                    them a bonus.

                <h2>Tips and Motivation</h2>

                <p>
                    Ms. Qistina gave a few tips to start in the field of
                    analytics:

                        <>Be confident in yourself</>
                        <>Do not give up!</>
                    </UnorderedList>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Remarks</h2>

                <p>
                    Ms. Qistina&apos;s talk introduced me to what is in the
                    field of analytics quite well. There are multiple
                    technologies that were used, and there are many field who
                    make use of those technologies too. Not only that, she also
                    introduced us into the workplace culture of a small company.
                    From the looks of it, the workers of small companies appear
                    to be close to each other, as there are only a few them. Her
                    tips were insightful. They were pretty common, but hearing
                    them again makes me not forget about them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A big thank you to Ms. Qistina for dedicating her time into
                    the industrial talk!
