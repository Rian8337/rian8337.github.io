                In December 6, 2023, had the chance to assemble a PC in a lab.

                For newcomers, assembling a PC may be scary and difficult.
                Fortunately, for me, this was simple because I have experiences
                in assembling PCs before.
            </p>

            <p>
                What was even more fortunate was the fact that the PC to
                assemble was simple (it only consisted of a central processing
                unit (CPU) and its fan, 2 random access memory (RAM) sticks, a
                hard disk drive (HDD), a power supply unit (PSU), and an optical
                drive reader), and the assembly did not involve installing the
                CPU. Despite that, it was still fun.
            </p>

            <p>
                To start with, my group installed the CPU fan on top of the CPU,
                and plugged the fan&apos;s power cable into the motherboard.
                Afterwards, we installed the HDD, which consisted of two cables.
                The first cable was to power the HDD, while the second one was
                to transfer data. After installing the HDD, we installed the
                RAM. The RAM slots must be opened first before pushing the RAM
                stick onto the motherboard, and when the RAM is locked, a click
                sound will appear. After installing the RAM, we installed the
                optical drive reader. Finally, we installed the PSU.
            </p>

            <p>
                After we made sure everything was connected properly, we closed
                the case and connected the PC to a monitor to test. The assembly
                was a success in the first attempt (and it was in under 15
                minutes)! However, we were not able to be the first group to do
                so as we had trouble fitting the PSU into the case.

                The knowledge that I applied here was nothing new. However,
                having a refresh of what I have done before was always certainly
                welcomed, and I was glad to be able to participate in this
                assembly.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would like to say thank you to those whom have given me the
                opportunity to participate in this PC assembly session.
