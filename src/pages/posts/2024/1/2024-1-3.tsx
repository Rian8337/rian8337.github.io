                    Ms. Liyana mentioned that knowledge of software architecture
                    and design will help QA design test cases that thoroughly
                    cover the software&apos;s functionality. In addition to
                    that, knowledge of programming will help in automated
                    testing, which requires scripting or programming skills. It
                    also enhances QA&apos;s ability to write test scripts and
                    understand the code being tested.

                    For me, this industrial talk was important to get to know
                    more about the kinds of ICT jobs that are available out
                    there. Not only that, this industrial talk gave me a chance
                    to directly ask those who were already working in the field,
                    which was a rare occasion when I was not actively looking
                    for such people.

                    I was able to learn how each job plays a role in the
                    company, and the skills needed to excel in each job
                    respectively. Moreover, there were two important aspects to
                    be mentioned: hard work and communication. Without hard
                    work, you will not be able to reach a higher level of a
                    certain position, and without communication, you will not be
                    able to work in teams, which is very important in companies
                    where you may have hundreds of colleagues working in the
                    same project.

                    A big thank you to Ms. Liyana, Ms. Syarifah, Mr. Saiful, Mr.
                    Ridwan, and Ms. Izzah for spending some of their time to
                    share their experience to me. I look forward to hearing more
                    work experiences in the future.
